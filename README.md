# Pet Adoption Drive

A simple website to find dogs available for adoption. It has a wide selection of dogs all over US with detailed information about the pets such as age/breed/activity levels/coatlength and their specific needs.



## Description

I would like to create an interactive app that would be simple to use, and easy to navigate. It is targeted for anyone who is keen on adopting a dog and provide a new loving home for these cute animals. We have a wide selection of dogs who deserve a second chance, spreading across the US states.

## User Interface/Instructions

```
An engaging and simple UI to facilitate the adoption process
Checkboxes
```



## Planning and Development Process
Nesting different components together 



## Problems
Most of the problems faced were related to the API call, as the data returned were disorganised and some of the values were left blank. This created problems as I coded for each individually returned pet. 


## Unsolved Problems
I was not able to do the checkbox and result to be instantly projected on the same page. The struggle was to filter the returned data.
