# Pet Adoption Drive

A simple website to find dogs available for adoption. It has a wide selection of dogs all over US with detailed information about the pets such as age/breed/activity levels/coatlength and their specific needs.

## Description

I would like to create an interactive app that would be simple to use, and easy to navigate. It is targeted for anyone who is keen on adopting a dog and provide a new loving home for these cute animals. We have a wide selection of dogs who deserve a second chance, spreading across the US states.
