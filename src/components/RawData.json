We are now in the process of having her mammary tumors removed and having her spayed.  Because she is such a small dog, this will take many surgeries and many  months of recovery.  She is not yet available, but if you think you may be interested,  please fill out an application and we can keep you informed on her progress.

She has been on different anxiety medicines in the past.&nbsp; She isn't taking any right now since she has been doing well.<br />She doesn't really like thunderstorms or fireworks.<br />She does not like to hear yelling.&nbsp; She will retreat to another room.<br />She does not like it when anyone throws their arms up in the air.&nbsp; She gets afraid and will growl and bark.<br />If you are working at the computer, she will come over and take her strong nose and move your arm when she thinks it is time to pet her.<br />She loves to go on walks.&nbsp; She gets excited when she hears the word 'walk' or sees me get her leash.&nbsp; She knows to 'go potty' in the yard before we start our walk, she never goes in anyone else's yard, then goes again in our yard when we return home.&nbsp; She loves smelling the other dogs' smells.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, she is not a trained walker.&nbsp; She pulls on the leash and darts from one side of our neighborhood road to the other.<br />She is not happy staying at a boarding kennel, but she did do pretty well the last time she stayed.&nbsp; Twice, when she was younger,&nbsp; she came home from the kennel licking her legs and paws.&nbsp; I stopped using the kennel and left her instead with my sister which Akita loved since my sister had other dogs.

She has been on different anxiety medicines in the past.&nbsp; She isn't taking any right now since she has been doing well.She doesn't really like thunderstorms or fireworks.She does not like to hear yelling.&nbsp; She will retreat to another room.She does not like it when anyone throws their arms up in the air.&nbsp; She gets afraid and will growl and bark.If you are working at the computer, she will come over and take her strong nose and move your arm when she thinks it is time to pet her.She loves to go on walks.&nbsp; She gets excited when she hears the word 'walk' or sees me get her leash.&nbsp; She knows to 'go potty' in the yard before we start our walk, she never goes in anyone else's yard, then goes again in our yard when we return home.&nbsp; She loves smelling the other dogs' smells.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, she is not a trained walker.&nbsp; She pulls on the leash and darts from one side of our neighborhood road to the other.She is not happy staying at a boarding kennel, but she did do pretty well the last time she stayed.&nbsp; Twice, when she was younger,&nbsp; she came home from the kennel licking her legs and paws.&nbsp; I stopped using the kennel and left her instead with my sister which Akita loved since my sister had other dogs. I tried the kennel again last year to see how she would do since my sister was unavailable.&nbsp; Akita had no problems on this last kennel stay.Akita will not make a good first impression with prospective families .&nbsp; She barks at strangers when she first meets new people.&nbsp; When the doorbell rings or she sees someone pull into the driveway, she barks frantically.&nbsp; She acts ferocious but she is really timid.&nbsp; She is especially leery of men.&nbsp; But, after a few minutes of interaction, she will sit in visitors' laps if they let her. &nbsp;I believe she would do best in an adult household who is looking for a second dog.&nbsp;&nbsp; She also needs a yard in which to run.Akita does not go up or down stairs.&nbsp; I have not worked with her to overcome that fear because my house does not have stairs. &nbsp;She has a benign fatty lump in her belly.&nbsp; Tidewater Vet evaluated her in Jan 2016 and said it was nothing to worry about.Akita's last shots were given 7-25-15 (including 3 year rabies).&nbsp; She takes heartworm preventative monthly and flea preventative during the warm months.&nbsp; She has been spayed.She will eat many different brands of dog food.&nbsp; Akita is content with Purina One.&nbsp; Sometimes I will buy a Sensitive Skin formula of one of the brands Petco carries because she tends to scratch a lot and I think it helps her scratch less.&nbsp; I usually give her 1/2-1 can of wet food each morning and leave dry food out throughout the day. &nbsp;It is difficult to give her up because I do love her.&nbsp; I never intended to get a dog, my granddaughter moved in with me and wanted her but she soon lost interest in having a dog.&nbsp; I am now retired and will be traveling even more.&nbsp; It isn't fair to keep putting Akita in the kennel especially when she isn't happy there. &nbsp;But, most importantly, Akita needs to be in a home with another dog.&nbsp; She seems lonely for the company of another dog.&nbsp; I really think she would be happier with another canine companion.

Bandit is energetic , loving and caring.  He is very loyal and a great watch dog  - in fact he even alerted us during a time when our home was being broken into.  For that fact alone, we know he loves us and would make a great pet to any loving family.  Bandit has been through obedience classes and knows the 10 basic commands.  He is great with kids and people and greets them all with open arms.  We even have to calm him down after the excitement of meeting new people.  Bandit enjoys car rides and also likes to go for walks, but prefers to be inside with his family. We would like to see Bandit go to a good stable home where he can get the attention and exercise he deserves and needs.  If you are looking for a good companion in life, we think you should come meet Bandit!!  We love Bandit very much but feel it is only fair to him and to our household to have him in another home where he can get better loving care.  Bandit is slender and in great health.  He recently had his teeth cleaned and all of his shots are up to date.  For pictures please visit: http://www.magsr.org/maleadopt.htm#bandit.
